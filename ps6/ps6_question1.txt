1.
Goal: Simulation studies were conducted to investigate the finite sample properties of the test.(More specifically, to evaluate the rate of convergence of 2LR to its limiting distribution)
Metrics: p-values computed from formula (14) with approximation error & truncation error

3. Yes, I think their tables are neat and clear.

4. 
(a)for single normal v.s. two component normal mixture:
There is no strong evidence that the power depends on the mixing proportion.
Generally speaking, the simulated power of unadjusted test is larger than that of adjusted tests
simulated power increase as D increase/¦Á increase/sample size increase
simulated power decrease as D decrease/¦Á decrease/sample size decrease


(b)for mixture of two normals v.s. mixture of three normals:
There is no strong correlation between sample size and power
Generally speaking, the simulated power of unadjusted test is larger than that of adjusted tests
simulated power increase as D1+D2 increase/¦Á increase
simulated power decrease as D1+D2 decrease/¦Á decrease

(a)I think 1000 simulation is appropriate:not computational intensive, and the sample size will not cause huge bias.
(b)10 simulation is not enough since it will cause variablity, unconverge bias and voluntary response bias.
(c)Use the formula of calculating sample size: n= (¦Ò*Z(¦Á/2) /d)^2, where ¦Ò is standard error, ¦Á=Pr(Type I error), d= 2*length_of_CI.
